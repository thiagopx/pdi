Welcome to the Digital Image Processing course repository! This repository contains support materials for the Digital Image Processing course hosted by the Federal Institute of Espírito Santo (IFES, PPComp), including Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and other useful stuff.

## Course Description

In this course, we will explore the fundamentals of digital image processing, including image enhancement, restoration, segmentation, and more.

## Content

This repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with course materials. Each notebook covers a specific topic and includes code examples and explanations.

- `images/`: This directory stores images used in the Jupyter notebooks.

- `scripts/`: This directory includes any supporting scripts or utility programs used in the course.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required Python packages. You can create a virtual environment (with virtualenv) and install these packages using the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of programming concepts and some familiarity with Python.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter notebooks and work on the course materials, you'll need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. You may follow the steps below (tested on Python 3.8.10 and Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS):

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/thiagopx/pdi.git` 
2. Change the current directory to the root of the project: `cd pdi`
3. If you don't have virtualenv installed, you can install it using pip, which is the package installer for Python: `pip install virtualenv`
4. Create a local virtual enviroment named `.venv`: `python3 -m venv .venv`
5. Now, activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate
6. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
